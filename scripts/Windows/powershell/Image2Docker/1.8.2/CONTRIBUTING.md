## Contributing to Image2Docker ##

Thank you so much for your interest in contributing to the Image2Docker tool ("i2d2"). Docker has open source in its DNA, and has always worked closely with the community.

Just a few quick things to be aware of before you get started.

We welcome issues and [signed pull requests](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sign-your-work) for either adding new features, or fixing a problem with an existing feature. 

Anything you contribute will be under an Apache license. Docker will choose which PRs to accept and reject. Anything posted here may be forked by anyone on GitHub.

We will be following the lightweight version of the Docker contribution policies and procedures as explained in
- [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com)
- The [Docker engine repo](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

This largely boils down to [signing your PRs](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sign-your-work), following the Docker [trademark guidelines](https://www.docker.com/trademark-guidelines), and following the community guidelines.
