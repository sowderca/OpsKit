SHORT DESCRIPTION
    PrtgAPI is a C#/PowerShell library for interacting with the PRTG HTTP API.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    PrtgAPI provides a series of methods and cmdlets that abstract away the complexity serializing and deserializing
    requests to and from the PRTG HTTP API. PrtgAPI enables the creation of scripts for customizing and standardizing
    PRTG Deployments.

    PrtgAPI cmdlets can be chained together for sophisticated object filtering, enabling object modification tasks
    to be performed against a select set of items.

EXAMPLES
    Before you can interface with your PRTG server you must enter your server credentials

    C:\> Connect-PrtgServer prtg.example.com

    PrtgAPI saves your credentials under the current PowerShell session so that they may be used for all PrtgAPI
    cmdlets.

    A list of sensors present on your PRTG server can be retrieved with the Get-Sensor cmdlet

    C:\> Get-Sensor

    Objects can be retrieved matching specific search criteria, such as having a certain name

    C:\> Get-Device *fw*

    Fields not supported by PrtgAPI Cmdlets can often be filtered for via the New-SearchFilter cmdlet

    C:\> New-SearchFilter type contains deprecated | Get-Sensor

    Multiple cmdlets can be chained together

    C:\> Get-Probe *office* | Get-Device *dc* | Get-Sensor -Tags wmipagefilesensor | Remove-Object -Force
